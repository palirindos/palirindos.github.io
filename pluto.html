        <div>Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies
            beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. After
            Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning in the 1990s,
            its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the
            Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris. This led the International Astronomical
            Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term "planet" — excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf
            planet.
        </div>
        <div>Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun. It is the largest
            known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto
            is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its
            volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical
            units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun
            than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding. Light from the Sun
            takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).
        </div>
        <div>Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix,
            Kerberos, and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of
            their orbits does not lie within either body.
        </div>
        <div>The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first and, to date,
            only spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations
            of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north
            pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of
            life, and produced from methane, nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and
            transferred 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.
