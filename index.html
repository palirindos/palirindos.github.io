            The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either
            directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,
            with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects
            that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

            The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
            molecular
            cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass
            contained
            in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being
            primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more
            massive
            than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of
            hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of
            substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
            water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc
            called the ecliptic.

            The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars
            and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond
            Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects
            composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these
            populations,
            some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate
            as to
            how many there will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain
            dwarf
            planet is Pluto, with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least
            close to being a dwarf planet. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations,
            including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the
            planets,
            the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,
            usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and
            other small objects.

            The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of
            the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the
            giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than
            90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets,
            moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.

            The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small
            inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by
            the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into
            separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.
            The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since the discovery
            of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of
            the objects beyond Neptune.
