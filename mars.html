        <div>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger
            than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the
            "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which
            gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars
            is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of
            the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
        </div>
        <div>Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar
            System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin
            in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two
            moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar
            to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
        </div>
        <div>Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars;
            launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. Mariner 4
            detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first
            images of another planet from deep space. The Soviet Mars 3 mission included a lander, which achieved a
            soft landing in December 1971; however, contact was lost seconds after touchdown. On 20 July 1976,
            Viking 1 performed the first successful landing on the Martian surface. On 4 July 1997, the Mars
            Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars and on 5 July released its rover, Sojourner, the first robotic rover to
            operate on Mars. The Mars Express orbiter, the first European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft to visit
            Mars, arrived in orbit on 25 December 2003. In January 2004, NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, named
            Spirit and Opportunity, both landed on Mars; Spirit operated until 22 March 2010 and Opportunity lasted
            until 10 June 2018. NASA landed its Curiosity rover on August 6, 2012, as a part of its Mars Science
            Laboratory (MSL) mission to investigate Martian climate and geology. On 24 September 2014, the Indian
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO) became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when its maiden
            interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, arrived in orbit. The United Arab Emirates
            became the fifth to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, having inserted an orbiter into the Martian
            atmosphere on 9 February 2021. China National Space Administration (CNSA)'s Tianwen-1 spacecraft arrived
            in Martian orbit on 10 February 2021. NASA's Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter successfully
            landed on Mars on 18 February 2021. Ingenuity successfully completed the first powered controlled flight
            by an aircraft on any planet besides Earth on 19 April 2021, taking off vertically, hovering and landing on
            Mars. On 14 May 2021, CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover successfully landed on Mars.
            Zhurong rover was successfully deployed on 22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to successfully
            deploy a rover on Mars, after the United States.

        <div>Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.
            Scientists initially determined that the core is at least partially liquid. Current models of its
            interior imply a core with a radius of about 1,794 ± 65 kilometres (1,115 ± 40 mi), consisting primarily of
            iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur. This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich in
            lighter elements as Earth's. The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many of the
            tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides silicon and oxygen, the
            most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, and potassium. The
            average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50 kilometres (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125
            kilometres (78 mi). Earth's crust averages 40 kilometres (25 mi).
