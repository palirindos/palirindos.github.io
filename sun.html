        <div>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
            heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible
            light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its
            diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about
            330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly
            three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
            smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.
        </div>
        <div>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not
            completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed
            approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of
            a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an
            orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually
            initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
        </div>
        <div>The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons
            of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years
            to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has
            diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a
            marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun
            into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits
            of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable â€“ but not for about five billion years. After this, it
            will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer
            produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.
