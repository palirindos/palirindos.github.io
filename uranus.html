        <div>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus,
            who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter)
            and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass
            in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions
            which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often
            classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. Uranus's
            atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it
            contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It
            has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371
            °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane
            the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.
        </div>
        <div>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
            system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of
            its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.
            In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
            cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to
            visit the planet. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as
            Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).
        </div>
        <div>Uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally
            mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BC might have
            recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's Almagest. The
            earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it
            as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between
            1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.
        </div>
        <div>Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years, taking an average of seven years to pass through each of the
            dozen constellations of the zodiac. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the
            Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta
            Tauri twice since then, in 1862 and 1943, one day later each time as the precession of the equinoxes has
            shifted it 1° west every 72 years. Uranus will return to this location again in 2030–31. Its average
            distance from the Sun is roughly 20 AU (3 billion km; 2 billion mi). The difference between its minimum and
            maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that
            of dwarf planet Pluto. The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on
            Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of
            light on Earth.
